<h1>Password Manager</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This is a bit of complex project as I created the password manager program. This program creates a text file that is called passwords.txt when the add function is called. The Account is added and the user and password is plit into variables at the special character "|" and stored into the txt file. The password is then encrypted when the user would like to view the accounts and the encryption key is converted in the key.key file and stored in the txt file in place of the passwords. This way if someone tries open the txt file to look at the passwords, they will be encrypted.
However, this one of the most basic forms of password encryprions, so it not recommended to use to store passwords.</p>
