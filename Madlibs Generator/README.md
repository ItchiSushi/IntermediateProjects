<h1>MadLibs Generator</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p align = "justify">In this program, I generated a random story and in the story, I used placeholders that will be located in the program. The story is placed in a .txt file and called into the program using best practice. The user is prompted to enter specific words like verbs, adjectives, and nouns and the story will replace the placeholders with those words.</p>
