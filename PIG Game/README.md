<h1>PIG Game</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p align = "justify">In this program, I created a turn-based multiplayer game using a dice. This die will be simulated using a function and the use of an import random library to randomize the dice value between 1 and 6. The program will prompt the user to choose the number of players in the game between 2 and 4 and each player will get a turn to play. Each player's turn will be looped through while loop that will either allow them to give up their turn or allow them to continuously roll the dice and accumulate points. If the player rolls a 1 then the player's score is reset to 0 and their turn is given up. This happens until one of the players reaches the max score first which is 20.</p>
